# Anime-Clip-Script-Matching
Create an AI-Powered Anime Clip Matching and Generation Tool

Creating a project based on downloading anime video clips with transcripts, generating AI scripts, and matching them through embeddings is a complex and exciting undertaking. Below are detailed **user stories**, their **descriptions**, and **acceptance criteria** to help you structure your project Kanban board.

### **Epic**: Create an AI-Powered Anime Clip Matching and Generation Tool

---

#### **Story 1**: **As a user, I want to search and fetch anime videos with their transcripts from online sources (e.g., YouTube).**
- **Description**:
  Implement functionality to search for anime-related videos using APIs and download available transcripts for analysis.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can input search keywords to find anime videos.
  - Fetch transcripts of videos using `youtube-transcript-api` or similar tools.
  - Save the video metadata (title, description, transcript, duration) in a database for future use.
  - Handle errors for unavailable transcripts gracefully.

---

#### **Story 2**: **As a user, I want to generate a story or script using generative AI.**
- **Description**:
  Provide a feature where users can input a theme, genre, or prompts to generate an anime-style script using a language model like GPT.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can input a theme, character details, or keywords.
  - Generate a coherent script or storyline split into scenes.
  - Allow users to download or edit the generated script.

---

#### **Story 3**: **As a user, I want to break the script into meaningful scenes for video matching.**
- **Description**:
  Implement functionality to divide a long script into smaller, logically connected scenes for easier video matching.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - NLP techniques are used to split the script based on logical breaks (e.g., changes in dialogue, actions, or location).
  - Each scene is treated as a separate unit and assigned a unique identifier.
  - Allow users to preview and adjust scene segmentation.

---

#### **Story 4**: **As a system, I want to generate embeddings for scripts and transcripts for similarity matching.**
- **Description**:
  Use a pre-trained embedding model like `Sentence-BERT` to convert the script and transcript into numerical vectors for semantic comparison.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Embed each scene from the script and each transcript segment.
  - Store embeddings in a searchable vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone).
  - Provide an API to retrieve the most similar transcript for a given scene.

---

#### **Story 5**: **As a user, I want to match my generated script scenes with the most relevant anime video segments.**
- **Description**:
  Use cosine similarity to match scenes from the script with video transcripts and suggest video segments for each scene.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Match each scene to the closest video transcript segment.
  - Return the video URL, start time, and end time for the best match.
  - Allow users to review and confirm suggested matches.

---

#### **Story 6**: **As a user, I want to download specific video segments based on matched scenes.**
- **Description**:
  Provide functionality to download matched video segments using tools like `pytube` and trim them to the relevant start and end times using FFmpeg.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can confirm which video segments to download.
  - Use FFmpeg to trim the downloaded video to the specified timestamps.
  - Save the final video segments locally or in cloud storage.

---

#### **Story 7**: **As a user, I want to compile matched video segments into a single video.**
- **Description**:
  After downloading the video segments, allow users to compile them into a cohesive video that aligns with the script flow.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can reorder or exclude video segments before compilation.
  - Compile video segments with seamless transitions using FFmpeg.
  - Allow users to preview and download the final video.

---

#### **Story 8**: **As a user, I want to track and manage my projects within the tool.**
- **Description**:
  Add functionality to save and manage multiple projects, each with its own script, video matches, and final output.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can create, save, and load projects.
  - Projects include script, matched segments, and final compiled video.
  - Allow deletion or modification of saved projects.

---

#### **Story 9**: **As a user, I want a web-based interface to interact with the tool.**
- **Description**:
  Develop a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the tool, including script input, scene preview, and video compilation.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can interact with the tool via a responsive web interface.
  - Include pages for uploading scripts, reviewing matches, and managing projects.
  - Provide clear feedback for loading, processing, and errors.

---

#### **Story 10**: **As a developer, I want to ensure compliance with copyright laws.**
- **Description**:
  Add disclaimers and ensure that the tool respects copyright policies by only using videos and transcripts for fair use purposes or with proper licensing.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Include warnings or disclaimers about copyright.
  - Restrict downloading and use of content to public domain or licensed materials.
  - Provide a toggle for "Use public content only" to limit search results to Creative Commons content.

---

### **Additional Features (Optional)**:
1. **Story**: **As a user, I want to edit the transcript text before matching.**
2. **Story**: **As a user, I want to automatically generate subtitles for the final video.**
3. **Story**: **As a user, I want to share my compiled video on social media directly from the tool.**
